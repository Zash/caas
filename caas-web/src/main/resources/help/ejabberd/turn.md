[Ejabberd 20.04](https://www.process-one.net/blog/ejabberd-20-04/) has support for XEP-0215 and has also a STUN and TURN server build in. Take a look a the new [sample config](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/blob/master/ejabberd.yml.example) (Particularly the `module: ejabberd_stun` section in the `listen` section and `mod_stun_disco`.)
